# Agile Approach
This project was designed and built using the agile approach, beginning from the initial planning until final deployment. For visualizing the different project elements I created a GitHub project and used the provided [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/HerFri/projects/13) to monitor my work progress. The project elements are assigned to different User Stories that can be opened to view the Acceptance Criteria and Tasks to be fulfilled. Moreover, every User Story has been tagged with a label to signify the priority and cruciality of the respective features to the overall workings and functionality of the website.

To view all User Stories including their required Acceptance Criterias and Tasks, please refer to the Kanban board linked above.

# User Experience

The goal of the site owner is to provide potential customers a big variety of different retro videogames and videogame consoles and to bring people closer to retro videogaming that just started to learn about it. People of all ages are encouraged to browse the catalogue of products, comment on certain videogames and consoles and to ask questions about them via an inquiry.

## User and Shopper goals

## Business Model
The business model is B2C (Business to Customer) which means that the business sells to private customers only. 

## Marketing Strategies
For this project several Marketing strategies were used which are SEO, Content Marketing, Social Media Marketing and Email Marketing.

## SEO 

### Site title and Extra Title
To improve SEO, 'RetroResell' has been added as title along with the
extra title 'Your Source for Retro Videogaming', which is the slogan of the website.


### Keywords
For the search of suitable keywords for my website I initially used wordtracker.com. Since the free trial only allowed two searches, I used Google search results as primary way of finding suitable keywords. To check the popularity of certain Short-tail and Long-tail keywords, I also checked the 'Related Searches' and 'People also ask' sections on Google. In my search for keywords I aimed at coming up with keywords that have high volume aswell as low competition. I came up with this list of relevant keywords that are most suitable for improving the site's ranking in search engine results, ranking the keywords by the number of search results:

**Short-tail keywords:**

- Video Games
- Nintendo
- Playstation
- Super Nintendo
- Buy Gameboy
- Retro Games
- Nintendo 64
- Playstation Portable
- Retro Console
- Super Gameboy
- Gameboy Color
- Retrogaming Shop

**Long-tail keywords:**
- Buy old Video Games
- Buy Video Games Online
- Used Video Games
- Vintage Video Games
- Second Hand Video Games 
- Super Mario Games
- Retro Video Games
- Buy Super Nintendo
- Retro Video Game Consoles
- Onlineshop for Video Games

These keywords are listed in the Meta block of the head section in the base.html to improve the SEO. Moreover, many keywords can be found in various parts of the website, as in e.g. product descriptions and the navigation bar.


### Content Marketing
As part of the content marketing strategy, authenticated users and customers can write comments about the products that are sold on the website. By giving the opportunity of writing comments and recommendations for products, users are engaged in giving their opinion about their favorite and least favorite products. Recommendations can send incentives to potential customers and can be considered as mouth to mouth marketing. Moreover, user engagement generates traffic on the website which benefits to the SEO ranking.

### Social Media Marketing

For a social media marketing approach, a Facebook MockUp Business Page has been created, that represents the business. Different current offers of the website are presented as posts that draw the attention of the subscribers to different kind of products that are on sale. The profile picture is the website's logo and the banner shows some of the website's products as well as the slogan.

</details>

Besides the Facebook Mock Up Page, there are Social Media clickable icons in the footer of the website, which by click open up a new tab to the respective social media site landing page. At this momement, there are no real social media pages provided to those links that represent the company, but these could be added in the future.

### Email Marketing

Visitors of the website can find a newsletter signup form in the footer where they can fill in their email without any further registration to receive a potential  newsletter via email that provides information about sales and new products of the website. The newsletter is handled by [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/de/?currency=EURFor). For the time being, visitors can enter their email address to signup but will not receive any actual newsletter, as this is not in the scope of this project.

### Favicon
To further enhance Branding, a Favicon, representing the business's logo, has been implemented to the website.

#### Robots.txt and Sitemaps.xml

To further enhance the website's SEO ranking, a robots.txt and a sitemap.xml file have been created. The robots.txt file informs search engines to avoid certain areas of the website. The sitemap.xml file was created using the xml-sitemaps.com website to provide a comprehensible understanding of the website's structure to search engines. By having a sitemap.xml file, search engines will crawl every important page on the website which enhances indexing.
