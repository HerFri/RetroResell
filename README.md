## Marketing Strategies

* For this project several Marketing strategies were used which are SEO, Content Marketing, Social Media Marketing and Email Marketing.

### SEO 

#### Keywords

For the search of suitable keywords for my website I initially used wordtracker.com. Since the free trial only allowed two searches, I used Google search results as primary way of finding suitable keywords. To check the popularity of certain Short-tail and Long-tail keywords, I also checked the 'Related Searches' and 'People also ask' sections on Google. In my search for keywords I aimed at coming up with keywords that have high volume aswell as low competition. I came up with this list of relevant keywords that are most suitable for improving the site's ranking in search engine results, ranking the keywords by the number of search results:

**Short-tail keywords:**

- Video Games
- Nintendo
- Playstation
- Super Nintendo
- Buy Gameboy
- Retro Games
- Nintendo 64
- Playstation Portable
- Retro Console
- Super Gameboy
- Gameboy Color
- Retrogaming Shop

**Long-tail keywords:**
- Buy old Video Games
- Buy Video Games Online
- Used Video Games
- Vintage Video Games
- Second Hand Video Games 
- Super Mario Games
- Retro Video Games
- Buy Super Nintendo
- Retro Video Game Consoles
- Onlineshop for Video Games

### Social Media Marketing

* For a social media marketing approach, a Facebook MockUp Business Page has been created, that represents the business and its contents. Different current offers of the website are presented as posts that draw the attention of the subscribers to different kind of products that are on sale. The profile picture is the website's logo and the banner shows some of the website's products as well as the slogan.

Besides the Facebook Mock Up Page, there are Social Media clickable icons in the footer of the website, which by click open up a new tab to the respective social media site landing page. At this momement, there are no real social media pages provided to those links that represent the company, but these could be added in the future.
