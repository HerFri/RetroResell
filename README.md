# Agile Approach
This project was designed and built using the agile approach, beginning from the initial planning until final deployment. For visualizing the different project elements I created a GitHub project and used the provided [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/HerFri/projects/13) to monitor my work progress. The project elements are assigned to different User Stories that can be opened to view the Acceptance Criteria and Tasks to be fulfilled. Moreover, every User Story has been tagged with a label to signify the priority and cruciality of the respective features to the overall workings and functionality of the website.

To view all User Stories including their required Acceptance Criterias and Tasks, please refer to the Kanban board linked above.

# User Experience

## Target Audience
The target audience are gamers of all ages that enjoy older videogames, videogame collectors and people who are interested in starting to play videogames.

## Site owner's goal
The goal of the site owner is to provide potential customers a big variety of different retro videogames and videogame consoles and to bring people closer to retro videogaming that just started to learn about it. People of all ages are encouraged to browse the catalogue of products, comment on certain videogames and consoles and to ask questions about them via an inquiry.

## Design
The design choices of the website are lead by the idea to present a modern online-shop that combines modern, simple design with elements that emphasize Retro Videogaming. For that reason, the interface has a modern touch, while the main background and the offered products present the vibrant style of Retro Videogames. 

The predominant colors of the website are white (#ffffff), black (#000000) and the blue background color (#2b3443) of the main background wallpaper, that also provides colors of light blue (#bcd9ff) and red (#fd453b). The main background wallpaper illustrates gmaing console controllers of different eras, emphasizing the theme of Retro Videogaming.

For the main font style I chose the ['Kdam Thmor Pro' font from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kdam+Thmor+Pro), because it presents a modern style that fits to the design of the website. This font is also used for the RetroResell logo at the top-left of the website.

## Wireframes

## Database Structure
To illustrate my database structure, I used [Lucidchart](lucid.app) to create an ERD-diagram:

For this project, Object-Oriented Programming princiciples and Django's class-based generic views were applied. For the User authentication system, the [Allauth library](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/) was used. Alongside the models presented in the E-Commerce walkthrough (User, UserProfile, Product, Order, OrderLineItem), I introduced the Category and Platform models that complement the Product model, as well as three other custom models (Wishlist, Inquiry, Comment) that provide additonal functionalities for the website:

### Wishlist
The Wishlist model includes two Foreign Keys, product and user. The product Foreign Key links to a specific product that has been added to the wishlist and the user Foreing Key to this specific user. Moreover, it comprises an added_on field that saves the date on which an item has been added to the wishlist.

### Inquiry
The Inquiry model has one Foreign Key that links to the User model, specifying the user who posted an inquiry. The name, email, phone_number fields are implemented in the Inquiry form of the website so that users can fill in their current personal data. The subject and order_number Charfield are used in the Inquiry form so users can fill in their reasons of their inquiry and the order number, if it is available. The created_on and updated_on DateTimeField track the dates, when an inquiry was posted or updated. By making use of the image field in the Inquiry form, users can upload pictures that are relevant to their inquiry. Finally, in the admin_reply TextField, the website admin can reply to a inquiry by adding a message through the admin panel.

### Comment
The Comment Model includes two Foreign Keys, the product field that is linked to the Product model and the respective product, which has been commented by the user, and the author field that is linked to the User model and therefore the user that commented on a product. Moreover, the comment model comprises the name field, through which comments can be assigned names through the admin panel, the body Textfield, in which the user writes the comment through the Comment form, the created_on field that specifies the date a comment has beend written, and the approved BooleanField, that is set by default to false. After commenting on a product, the comment has to be approved by the admin, setting this field to true and making it visible on the website.

# Features
## Base
As this project was made with the Django framework, every page of the website extends its' content from the base.html file, meaning that the content of the base.html is present in every website page. In the following, those features are presented that are extended from the base.html file.

### Navigation Bar
The responsive navigation bar consists of the RetroResell logo, the search bar, the delivery threshold banner, the navbar menu and the clickable icons including the links that lead to the 'My Account', 'My Wishlist' and the Shopping Cart pages. The RetroResell logo serves as a clickable home button that leads users back to the homepage. Under the search bar the navbar menu is located, which comprises the product categories of the website 'All Products', 'Consoles', 'Games', 'Equipment/Miscellaneous' and the 'Sell Your Games & Consoles!' section, that leads to the Inquiry Page if users are authenticated. If unauthenticated or not logged in users click the 'My Account' icon, the dropdown menu will show the options 'Register' and 'Login'.
![Navbar]()

Logged in users will see the options 'My Profile', 'My Inquiries' and 'Logout', while the website admin will additionally see the option 'Product Management' in the dropdown menu.
![Navbar logged in]()

By clicking the 'My Wishlist' icon or the navbar option 'Sell Your Games & Consoles!', not logged in users are lead to the log in page.
![Login page]()

By clicking on one of the product categories of the navbar menu, a dropdown menu will open which shows the available platforms for each category.
![Navbar Menu Options]()

For the 'All Products' navbar menu item, it will show all available options to sort all products.
![Navbar All Products]()

In the middle of the navbar users can find the searchbar. By implementing the search results functionality, users can search for their desired products. By typing in a search term and clicking the search icon, the systems checks if the desired product is available. In the screenshit below, a user searched for the term 'Nintendo 64', and the system found one product, emphasizing it by showing the text '1 Product found for 'Nintendo 64'.
![Product Found]()

If the desired product was not found, the text will indicate that zero products have been found. In the screenshot below, a user searched for the term 'SEGA Genesis', but the system could not find any product that relates to this term.
![Product not Found]()

The delivery threshold banner under the navbar menu informs user of the free delivery for orders over 70€.
![Delivery Banner]()


The navbar is fully responsive and will show a burger menu with all options for devices with smaller width:

### Footer
As the navbar, the footer is present on all pages of the website and is fully responsive. It consists of some information like the address and email adress of the website's company, the clickable Privacy Policy, the clickable social media icons and the RetroResell Newsletter.
![Footer]()

By clicking 'Our Privacy Policy', a new tab will be opened with the company's privacy policy, where users can read about how their data is processed.

In the middle of the footer there are the clickable social media icons that, by clicking on the respective icon, will open the respective social media page in a new tab. Next to it is the newsletter signup form where interested users can sign up for the RetroResell newsletter.

## Homepage



## Business Model
The business model is B2C (Business to Customer) which means that the business sells to private customers only. 

## Marketing Strategies
For this project several Marketing strategies were used which are SEO, Content Marketing, Social Media Marketing and Email Marketing.

## SEO 

### Site title and Extra Title
To improve SEO, 'RetroResell' has been added as title along with the
extra title 'Your Source for Retro Videogaming', which is the slogan of the website.

### Keywords
For the search of suitable keywords for my website I initially used wordtracker.com. Since the free trial only allowed two searches, I used Google search results as primary way of finding suitable keywords. To check the popularity of certain Short-tail and Long-tail keywords, I also checked the 'Related Searches' and 'People also ask' sections on Google. In my search for keywords I aimed at coming up with keywords that have high volume aswell as low competition. I came up with this list of relevant keywords that are most suitable for improving the site's ranking in search engine results, ranking the keywords by the number of search results:

**Short-tail keywords:**

- Video Games
- Nintendo
- Playstation
- Super Nintendo
- Buy Gameboy
- Retro Games
- Nintendo 64
- Playstation Portable
- Retro Console
- Super Gameboy
- Gameboy Color
- Retrogaming Shop

**Long-tail keywords:**
- Buy old Video Games
- Buy Video Games Online
- Used Video Games
- Vintage Video Games
- Second Hand Video Games 
- Super Mario Games
- Retro Video Games
- Buy Super Nintendo
- Retro Video Game Consoles
- Onlineshop for Video Games

These keywords are listed in the Meta block of the head section in the base.html to improve the SEO. Moreover, many keywords can be found in various parts of the website, as in e.g. product descriptions and the navigation bar.

### Content Marketing
As part of the content marketing strategy, authenticated users and customers can write comments about the products that are sold on the website. By giving the opportunity of writing comments and recommendations for products, users are engaged in giving their opinion about their favorite and least favorite products. Recommendations can send incentives to potential customers and can be considered as mouth to mouth marketing. Moreover, user engagement generates traffic on the website which benefits to the SEO ranking.

### Social Media Marketing

For a social media marketing approach, a Facebook MockUp Business Page has been created, that represents the business. Different current offers of the website are presented as posts that draw the attention of the subscribers to different kind of products that are on sale. The profile picture is the website's logo and the banner shows some of the website's products as well as the slogan.

  <summary>Facebook Mockup Page</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/HerFri/RetroResell/blob/main/docs/readme-images/facebook_mock_up.png?raw=true"><br>
</details>

Beside the Facebook Mock Up Page, there are Social Media clickable icons in the footer of the website, which by click open up a new tab to the respective social media site landing page. At this momement, there are no real social media pages provided to those links that represent the company, but these could be added in the future.

### Email Marketing

Visitors of the website can find a newsletter signup form in the footer where they can fill in their email without any further registration to receive a potential  newsletter via email that provides information about sales and new products of the website. The newsletter is handled by [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/de/?currency=EURFor). For the time being, visitors can enter their email address to signup but will not receive any actual newsletter, as this is not in the scope of this project.

### Favicon
To further enhance Branding, a Favicon, representing the business's logo, has been implemented to the website.

#### Robots.txt and Sitemaps.xml

To further enhance the website's SEO ranking, a robots.txt and a sitemap.xml file have been created. The robots.txt file informs search engines to avoid certain areas of the website. The sitemap.xml file was created using the xml-sitemaps.com website to provide a comprehensible understanding of the website's structure to search engines. By having a sitemap.xml file, search engines will crawl every important page on the website which enhances indexing.
